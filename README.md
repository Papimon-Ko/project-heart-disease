#  Predicting heart disease using machine learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science librraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predictiong whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes

we're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Feature
5. Modeling
6. Experimentation

## Problem Definition

in a statement,
> Giving clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
